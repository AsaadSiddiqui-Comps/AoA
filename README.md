# AoA — Analysis of Algorithms (C implementations)

This repository contains a collection of classic algorithm implementations in C, intended for study and experimentation. The top-level files are small example programs (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.).

Quick overview
--------------
- Source files (C): each `.c` file implements one algorithm. You can find them at the repository root.
- `build/`: produced by the helper scripts and by compilation; contains compiled executables, per-file compile logs and run logs, and the consolidated `build/report.txt`.
- `CODE_REPORT.md`: a generated human-readable report summarizing compilation and example inputs.

How this README is organized
---------------------------
1. Files and a one-line description for each source.
2. How to build everything at once.
3. How to run individual programs (with example inputs).
4. Known issues and quick fixes.

Files (what's in this repo)
---------------------------
- `AllPairShortestPath.c` — Floyd–Warshall variant; reads n m then m edges (u v w) and prints all-pairs shortest path matrix.
- `binarySearch.c` — Recursive binary search on a sorted integer array.
- `insertionSort.c` — Insertion sort (reads n and n integers). Note: uses `conio.h` in original version — see Known issues.
- `mergeSort.c` — Merge sort (reads n and n integers).
- `quicksort.c` — Quicksort (reads n and n integers). Note: includes `conio.h` in original version.
- `selectionSort.c` — Selection sort (reads n and n integers). Note: includes `conio.h` in original version.
- `Knapsack.c` — Fractional knapsack (reads n, weights[], profits[], capacity).
- `LCS-problem.c` — Longest Common Subsequence (reads two strings via stdin lines).
- `N-Queen-Probelm.c` — N-Queens backtracking (reads n and prints solutions).
- `NaiveMethod.c` — Naive substring search (reads text and pattern lines).

Build everything
----------------
To compile all `.c` files into the `build/` directory and capture per-file compile logs, run the following from the repository root:

```bash
mkdir -p build
for f in *.c; do
  exe="${f%.c}"
  gcc -std=c99 -O2 "$f" -o "build/$exe" 2> "build/$exe.compile.log" || true
done
```

After this, `build/` will contain executables (for files that compiled successfully) and `*.compile.log` files with compiler output.

Run one program (examples)
--------------------------
You can pass inputs using printf + pipe. A few examples from `CODE_REPORT.md` (already generated):

- All-Pairs Shortest Path (example):

```bash
printf "4 5\n1 2 3\n1 3 8\n2 3 2\n3 4 1\n4 2 -4\n" | ./build/AllPairShortestPath
```

- Binary Search (example):

```bash
printf "5\n1 2 3 4 5\n3\n" | ./build/binarySearch
```

- Knapsack (example):

```bash
printf "3\n10 20 30\n60 100 120\n50\n" | ./build/Knapsack
```

See `CODE_REPORT.md` for more example inputs and suggested run commands for each program.

Known issues and quick fixes
---------------------------
Several files include `#include<conio.h>` which is a non-standard header typically available only on DOS/Windows compilers (Turbo C/Borland). On Linux (gcc) this header does not exist and causes compilation to fail. The affected files in this repo are:

- `insertionSort.c`
- `quicksort.c`
- `selectionSort.c`

Quick fix (safe in these programs):

1. Remove the `#include<conio.h>` line.
2. Change `void main()` to `int main()`.
3. Add `return 0;` at the end of `main`.

Example of the minimal change to `main` (illustrative):

```c
// before:
// void main() {
//    ...
// }

// after:
int main(void) {
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

Notes
-----
- A few programs compiled with warnings (ignored return values from scanf/fgets). Warnings are generally harmless for small study examples, but you can check `build/*.compile.log` for details.

Reports and logs
----------------
- `build/report.txt` — consolidated compilation/run report (auto-generated by the helper script used earlier).
- `CODE_REPORT.md` — a human-friendly report I generated listing per-file statuses and example inputs.

Suggested next steps
--------------------
1. Apply the small conio.h/main fixes to the three files and re-run the build script above.
2. Use the example inputs in `CODE_REPORT.md` to validate behavior and capture outputs into `build/<exe>.run.log`:

```bash
printf "...example input..." | ./build/<exe> > build/<exe>.run.log 2>&1
```

3. If you want, I can apply the three fixes automatically and recompile and run all programs with the example inputs. Ask me to proceed and I will perform the edits and re-run the verification.

Contact / Troubleshooting
-------------------------
If a program prints nothing when run, it's likely waiting for stdin; use the example inputs or run interactively and type values when prompted. For compilation errors, inspect `build/*.compile.log`.

Enjoy exploring these algorithm implementations! If you want me to automatically fix the `conio.h` files and re-run everything, say "please fix and re-run" and I'll do it for you.
